          About
        </h2>

        <p>
          I am a full stack software developer with experience in both
          technology and education, combining technical problem-solving
          with clear communication and purpose-driven work.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over the past year, I have been building results through academic
          and personal projects, as well as teaching English to more than
          <strong className="text-white"> 20 students</strong>, consistently
          improving their performance through personalized learning
          strategies.
        </p>

        <p>
          My focus is on building functional, well-structured systems and
          sharing knowledge in a way that generates real impact.
